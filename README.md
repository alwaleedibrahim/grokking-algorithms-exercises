# Grokking Algorithms Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises in the book [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms) by Aditya Bhargava. The book is a friendly introduction to the most essential algorithms in computer science, with examples in Python.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to practice and improve my algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills by implementing the algorithms and data structures presented in the book, as well as applying them to various challenges.

## Solutions

Each chapter of the book has a corresponding markdown file in this repository, where I provide my solutions to the exercises, along with explanations and comments. You can access them by clicking on the links below:

## Disclaimer

Please note that the solutions in this repository are my own attempts and may not be perfect or optimal. I have tried to follow the book's explanations and examples as much as possible, but I may have made some mistakes or overlooked some details. Therefore, you should always check the correctness and efficiency of the solutions before using them for any purpose. I am not responsible for any errors or inaccuracies in the solutions. If you find any, please let me know and I will try to fix them. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.üôè
