### 3.1 
Suppose I show you a call stack like this.
What information can you give me, just based on this call stack? 
Now letâ€™s see the call stack in action with a recursive function

Answer: 
- Greet function was called and was passed the name Maggie to it 
- Greet function is partially completed
- Greet2 function is called inside Greet function
- Greet2 function will be completed first, then Greet will be coninued

### 3.2 
Suppose you accidentally write a recursive function that runs 
forever. As you saw, your computer allocates memory on the 
stack for each function call. What happens to the stack when your 
recursive function runs forever?

- Answer: the stack gets full. The term for this condition is stack overflow.
